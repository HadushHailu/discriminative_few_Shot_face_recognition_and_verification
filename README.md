# discriminative_few_Shot_face_recognition_and_verification
A discriminative few-shot learning approach for face recognition and verification using a Siamese network architecture. Employing a triplet loss function, the model optimizes the embedding space to cluster faces of the same individual and separate those of different individuals, enhancing accuracy and efficiency with limited training data.
